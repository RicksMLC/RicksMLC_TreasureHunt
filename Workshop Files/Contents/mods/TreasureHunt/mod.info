description=This mod is a framework for adding treasure hunts to Project Zomboid.  A treasure hunt is a sequence of generated treasure maps which uses the Annotated Map functionality of the vanilla game.  Included in this mod are sample treasure hunts to demonstrate the how to define treasure hunts.  Treasure hunt locations (Stash buildings) can be set to random or specific Towns.   The Treasure Hunt mod contains the following Towns: Riverside, Westpoint, MarchRidge, Muldraugh and Louisville 1 to 9.  Custom town regions can be added in your mod to be used in your treasure hunt definitions, and the town of Ekron is added in the sample to show how this is done.  The Stash building will be chosen at random in the specified town or a random town from the list of known towns. <LINE>

description=Placing the found treasure item in your inventory/bag will trigger the next map on the next zombie you hit.  The sample hunt has eight treasures to be found, as well as example of more complex loot definition for the building which has the treasure. <LINE>

description=NOTE: Issues: There may be some buildings chosen by the treasure hunt which have errors when the "Stash" is spawned.  So far the only building with this issue is the school at Rosewood, which threw a Java exception while trying to barricade an IsoWindow.  This building has been set to not generate barricades to avoid this issue. <LINE>
