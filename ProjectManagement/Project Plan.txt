Project Plan.txt

Features:
    [+] Treasure Hunt
        [+] Treasure Hunt is Initialsed, Generated and Stash populated.
        [+] Determine if a treasure hunt item is found and the next map needs generating
        [+] Spawns a treasure map when a zombie is hit.
        [+] Each Treasure Map is generated when needed (ie: when a zombie is hit)
        [-] Allow each treasure in the list to have an optional town/co-ords for its position, instead of the one Town. (See Update #2)
        [ ] Allow a predicate for building selection so the map maker can set any criteria for a building (size, type, name, location etc...)
    [+] Treasure Hunt Mgr
        [+] Init populates default treasure hunts
        [+] Detects treasure found and sets the treasure hunt to spawn a new map
    [-] Samples
        [+] Intial sample run/load/save reproduced from the old TreasureHuntMgr hard-coded treasure hunt
        [+] Document process of creating a treasure hunt from scratch
        [ ] Treasure Hunt Distributions sample
    [-] Tresure Hunt Distributions
        [+] Add a new distribution after the vanilla post-distributions event has occurred.  This makes on-the-fly treasure maps possible
            [ ] Needs investiation to see if calling the ItemPickerJava.Parse() in RicksMLC_TreasureHuntDistributions is correct.
        [-] Multiple items in a single treasure hunt map  - Phase 3? (Update #2)
    [+] Add callback decorator function to apply extra map annotations on map definition - see RicksMLC_SampleTreasureHunts.lua (Update #1)
    [-] Investigate and add more addContainer() calls to add more things like survivor loot to the stashMap. see RicksMLC_SampleTreasureHunts.lua (Update #2)
    [x] Can map annotations be added after definition? - Not really.  See Java Stash.load()
    [ ] Return error code if duplicate treasure hunt name detected
    [-] Multiplayer:  This is bigger than this one line item would suggest o.O
        [ ] Test Chat Treasure
        [ ] Game Modes
    [ ] Move Treasure Map decorations to the mapItem ModData.

Future Features:
    [ ] Spawn a TreasureMap as part of the loot table, instead of on a zombie?

Update #1:
    [+] Custom annotations

Update #2:
    [-] Additional loot definition
    [ ] Fine-grained treasure item map specification
        [ ] location
        [ ] container
    

Test Plan:
    [+] Sandbox option for loading Samples
    [+] Samples are loaded once only
    [+] Samples are re-loaded using the ModData
    [+] Add a new treasure hunt (Greenport Secrets qualifies as a new treasure hunt)
    [-] Added treasure hunt is re-loaded on subsequent startup
    [-] Do not add a treasure hunt with the same name (avoid duplicates)

    [ ] Multiplayer
        [ ] Chat TreasureHunt -> Player A.  
            [ ] Player B hits zombie = no map
                Fail: Player B hit zombie and zombie had three maps on him, and it generated three maps on Player A location.
            [ ] Player A hits zombie = map
                Fail: due to previous test fail.
            [ ] Player A opens map: Annotations Included
            [ ] Player A finds Treasure
            [ ] Player B hits zombie = no new map
            [ ] Player A hits zombie = new map
            [ ] Player A gives map to Player B
            [ ] Player B reads map with annoatations.
            [ ] Player B finds treasure.
        [ ] Chat TreasureHunt -> Player A
            Fail: ChatTreasure -> "Cruel Moose" but hunt is named "Rick's MLC"
                    Player is Cruel Moose, but restrict to user is RicksMLC
            [ ] Player B finds treasure in stash house
            [ ] Player A hits zombie = no new map
            [ ] Player B hits zombie = new map
            [ ] Player A finds treasure 
            [ ] Player B hits zombie = no new map
            [ ] Player A hits zombie = new map.
        
    Fix: ChatTreasure - Name the map for the player to receive the map.

TODO:
    [+] Error console.txt: RicksMLC_TreasureHuntSystemC:new()    -> Remove this class.

    [ ] Hit Zombie fault: Fail: Player B hit zombie and zombie had three maps on him, and it generated three maps on Player A location.
        PlayerA hitting a zombie spawns maps on the hit zombie and the PlayerB location.
        PlayerB (Cruel Moose) had a red error box pop up:
            Cruel Moose console.txt: RicksMLC_TreasureHuntMgrClient:RecreateMapItem() ERROR: no stash for 'RicksMLC_TreasureMap_RicksMLC's_Great_Quest_II_2'
                Callframe at: doStashItem
                function: RecreateMapItem -- file: RicksMLC_TreasureHuntMgrClient.lua line # 210 | MOD: Rick's MLC Treasure Hunt (MP TEST)
                function: HandleOnMapItemsGenerated -- file: RicksMLC_TreasureHuntMgrClient.lua line # 227 | MOD: Rick's MLC Treasure Hunt (MP TEST)
                function: OnServerCommand -- file: RicksMLC_TreasureHuntMgrClient.lua line # 301 | MOD: Rick's MLC Treasure Hunt (MP TEST)

        Cruel Moose's console.txt shows "RicksMLC_TreasureHuntSharedMP:RestrictMapToPlayer() Cruel Moose" when it should already be restricted
        to RicksMLC.
        It looks like the RicksMLC_TreasureHuntMgrServer.GetPlayer() may not have found the correct player

    [ ] ChatTreasure fault: ChatTreasure for PlayerB (non-host) records Player: PlayerB, but the Restrict To Player is still PlayerA(host)

    [ ] Player B finished treasure hunt.  Server lists hunt as finished, but client still says Active
