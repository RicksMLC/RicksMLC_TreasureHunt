Initial phase is now re-working.  Generates the treasure maps on the client first zombie hit, and the server assigns the map and creates the item.

To do:
    1) Barricades are not real for the client.  They are visible, but not real.  Logging off and back on removes them.  
        Sometimes they are real, and sometimes they are not.  It may be the client is sending the read update to the server
        before the server can call mapItem:doBuildingStash().  Check if there is code to prevent it from doing twice.
        The client is not supposed to doStash anyway?
        The mapItem creation code calls the doStashItem and doBuildingStash on the server, so the map reading on the client
        should be redundant?  The treasure was found in the cabin with fake barricades, so maybe the fake ones are an 
        artifact of teleporting to the site and the building is not fully spawned in. See StashSystem var2.getBuilding().isFullyStreamedIn()
        and check this before calling doBuilding() as a warning when teleporting, or at least check for corellation.

    2) The second treasure (Fluffyfoot) is not not created.  Dunno why yet.
